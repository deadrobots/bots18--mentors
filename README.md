1. Commit to repo  
1. Build a two motor robot
1. Write/run/test/commit ‘drive forward a few inches’
1. Rewrite using constants for port numbers
1. Write/run/test/commit ‘drive then turn right’
1.  Write ‘self test’ [run/test/commit assumed moving forward]
1.  Refactor to put constants in a separate file
1.  Refactor to put actions in a separate file
1.  Write ‘move forward (a foot)’ [after ‘self test’ runs]

1.  Write ‘drive a square’ [time limit:  1 hour]
1.  Perform code review with a mentor
1.  Write ‘debug (message)’ [testing assumed]
1.  Write ‘wait for button’
1.  Mount a servo with 6” arm on front of robot
1.  Create a repo branch ‘front servo’
1.  Update constants & self test [commit into the branch, not master]
1.  Write ‘move servo slowly’
1.  Write a unit test for ‘move servo slowly’
1.  Create a Pull Request (PR) to merge back to master
1.  Have a mentor review/accept your PR
